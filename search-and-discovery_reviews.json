Yes, it probably doesn't work on all themes yet (I'm using Minimog). But this app deserves much credit.

Not being able to customize related items was one of my biggest peeves about Shopify, second only to a lack of one-page checkout. The synonyms didn't seem to work when I first installed it, but all good now. People make typos or misspell things and come up empty-handed. Previously I would sprinkle some common misspellings in descriptions or switch between using a hyphen or not, so people would always be able to find something. Eww. Problem solved. :) I can't speak to the filter settings - we use tag filters, so they're not relevant for us. Only complaint is that I can't seem to sort the products that I've added related items to. It would be nice to be able to search or list alphabetical.
