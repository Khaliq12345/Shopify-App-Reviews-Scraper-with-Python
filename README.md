# Shopify-App-Reviews-Scraper-with-Python
Scraping Shopify product reviews with Python is an easy project that also has some real-world use, comparing products and doing research. This repo will show you how I would write a basic Shopify product review scraper, much improved from my previous scrapers, using better fitting tech and writing a more stable scraper.

## Prerequisites
Before running the web scraping script, make sure you have the following installed:

Python

Requests_html

latest_user_agents

## Notes
Please be mindful of the website's terms of service and policies while scraping. 
Ensure that your scraping activities are legal and respectful of the website's resources.
The provided scraper is tailored to the current structure and layout of the Shopify website. 
If the website structure changes significantly, the scraper may require adjustments to function correctly.
