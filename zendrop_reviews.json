My problem was I signed up to Plus plan with a 7 day free trial but Zendrop charged me right away. They did provide me the refund but the charge threw me off and I cancelled the plus plan right away without checking out all the features. Nonetheless so far so good. The only other thing is products take too long to arrive for my customers if they worked on shipping Zendrop can become huge.",

I am really glad I did this before anyone ordered from me because I would hate to come off looking like a fraud. I am a bit pissed because I spent all this time marketing the items and listing them in different places now I have to go back and remove them. Time wasted, but that's my fault because I should have ordered the test first. Also for the 1st tier-paid subscription, you really don't get a lot of benefits.

Also Thank You cards haven't been working so far and order credits don't show up (maybe because I'm on the trial of the Plus Plan). Anyways supportwise though, it's perfect. Theresa, Molly and ESPECIALLY Michael have been a really big help overcoming those issues and are always here for me if there are any more. They really seem to care about my business and are understanding and (I think is also a really big point) fluent in English! Overall okay Dropshipping service with perfect support. Again, thank you Michael for everything!",
